# One or a few scripts:
#   - Download ncbi database
#   - Download bold data
#   - Add data from ncbi to bold-downloaded data (using blast search)
#   - Add own data

# (Maybe use ASAP or decipher to create our own bins)
# Probably, or use the same system bold uses (if that is public and r/python/c/java/some language i know - friendly)
# This would improve it quite a bit

# Filter data to raise bags score
# Shiny app:
#   - Show scores
#   - Pick out samples making it bad
#   - Allow the user to remove those

# Search with new sequences (ASAP or decipher)
#   - Allow user to choose what database to match against
#       - That is before or after the bags filtering
# Show matches
# If they match, add option to merge into data
